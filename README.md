# CoinMarketCap-API

An API implementation written in Java for the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).

The library has been updated to work with API v2 from CMC. Please report any issues and/or feature requests here on github.
## Installation
I have released this library onto maven central:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.lucadev</groupId>
    <artifactId>coinmarketcap-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage
```java
CoinMarketList coinMarkets  = CoinMarketCap.ticker().setLimit(5).convert(Currency.EUR).get();
coinMarkets.forEach(System.out::println);

//find a market
CoinMarket bitcoinMarket = coinMarkets.getByName("bitcoin");
System.out.println(bitcoinMarket.getUSDPriceQuote().getPrice());

System.out.println("Specific Currency:");

CoinMarket market = CoinMarketCap.ticker(1).get();
System.out.println(market);

System.out.println("Specific currency by market name:");
CoinMarket namedMarket = CoinMarketCap.ticker("bitcoin").get();
System.out.println(namedMarket);
```

An example implementation can be found in the maven test sources.
